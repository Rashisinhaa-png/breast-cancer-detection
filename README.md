# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Title
Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and may lead to human error. Hence, there is a need for an automated system that can assist in detecting breast cancer efficiently and accurately.
